Why would that be important? Can you write code for that and report your results. |
| **Stage 3 – Learning Plan** | **Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction**<br><br>**Lesson 1—Exploring Your Dataset with FiftyOne App and SDK:** This lesson will show my screen as I explore the image dataset via the FiftyOne app. I will provide a crash course on using the app to explore the dataset. I'll also talk about how we can use the SDK to filter and explore the dataset, and I'll discuss the plugin ecosystems and the necessary plugins we will need for the coming lessons.<br><br>**Lesson 2 - Analyzing Image Quality: Brightness, Blurriness, and Contrast:** This lesson will have a slide component and a coding component. In the slides, I will define image quality metrics: brightness, blurriness, contrast, etc. I'll share, at a high level, how these metrics are computed and what their potential impact is on model quality. Then, in the coding portion, I will pick one of the metrics and curate a dataset based on that metric and showcase the impact of this on model performance by fine-tuning a model on the curated dataset.<br><br>**Lesson 3—Detecting Outliers in Your Dataset:** This lesson will have a slide component and a coding component. I'll focus on embeddings-based workflows for outlier detection, showing how we can use embeddings to find clusters of images and visually inspect the cluster's contents. I'll also discuss the local outlier factor. The coding portion will show how to compute embeddings and the LOF score. No model training will occur here.<br><br>**Lesson 4—Finding Duplicates and Near-Duplicates:** This lesson will have a slide component and a coding component. I'll discuss the importance of identifying and managing duplicate and near-duplicate records in visual datasets and their impact on model performance. I'll also showcase how to find exact and near-duplicate images in FiftyOne.<br><br>**Lesson 5—Understanding Semantic Scores:** This lesson will have a slide component and a coding component. I'll discuss metrics for quantifying image complexity and object density and how to assess clutter and semantic diversity in images. I'll also discuss the potential impact this can have on model performance. Then, I'll showcase how to write code to compute these metrics and inspect the results.<br><br>**Lesson 6—Assessing Scene Diversity:** This lesson will have a slide and coding component. I'll discuss measures like the arrangement and distribution of objects within the scene and using zero-shot models to categorize the overall scene type. There will also be code on how to compute these.<br><br>**Lesson 7—Hands-on: Identifying and Addressing Image Quality Issues:** This lesson will be code-based. I'll demonstrate a workflow for curating a dataset based on what we learned in this lesson, apply a model to the curated dataset, and assess model performance. |
