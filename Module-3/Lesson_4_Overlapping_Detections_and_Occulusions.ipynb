    "1. `detect_image_occlusion` function:\n",
    "   This function is the main driver for occlusion detection. It processes each ground truth detection in a given image sample. For each detection:\n",
    "   - It extracts a region of interest (ROI) around the bounding box, adding a 20% padding to capture potential occlusions just outside the box.\n",
    "   - It applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise, which helps in more accurate edge detection.\n",
    "   - Canny edge detection is used to identify edges in the ROI.\n",
    "   - Hough Line Transform is applied to detect straight lines from the edges.\n",
    "   - For each detected line, it checks if the line intersects or is close to the original (unpadded) bounding box using the `line_box_intersection` function.\n",
    "   - If any line is found to intersect or be close to the box, it's considered a potential occlusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The function includes several safety checks, such as ensuring the image can be loaded and the ROI is valid, to handle potential edge cases in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `line_box_intersection` function:\n",
    "   This function determines whether a given line segment potentially represents an occlusion for a bounding box. It uses two methods:\n",
    "   - Line Intersection: It checks if the line segment intersects any of the edges of the bounding box. This is done efficiently using the concept of counterclockwise (CCW) orientation of points.\n",
    "   - Proximity Check: If the line doesn't intersect the box, it checks if any part of the line is within a small threshold distance (5 pixels) from the box. This catches cases where an occluding object might be very close to but not quite touching the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The CCW check is a clever way to determine if two line segments intersect without actually calculating the intersection point, making it computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions work together to provide a heuristic approach to detecting potential occlusions. While not perfect (it may have false positives or miss some occlusions), it provides a computationally efficient way to flag images that might have occlusion issues for further review or processing."

    "2. Dealing with limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Addressing signs of overfitting to specific features in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several effective techniques can be used to simulate occlusions and improve model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random erase**: These methods involve randomly removing or masking sections of the input image during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CutMix**: This technique replaces a section of one image with a section from another, encouraging the model to learn from partial information and diverse contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mosaic**: This method stitches together four images, forcing the model to identify objects in various contexts and positions within a single training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MixUp**: While not strictly an occlusion technique, MixUp combines multiple images at the pixel level, which can help the model learn patterns related to partially visible objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these techniques, we challenge our models to learn more robust and generalizable features, ultimately improving their performance in real-world scenarios where occlusions are common.\n",
